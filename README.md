A visual explanation of RNNs and a step by step guide to building them with Keras and Tensorflow Python libraries.

Explanation: Modeling and predicting sequential data requires a different approach from standard regression or classification. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are specifically designed for that purpose. I covered the structure of RNNs and gave a complete example of how to build a simple RNN using Keras and Tensorflow in Python.
